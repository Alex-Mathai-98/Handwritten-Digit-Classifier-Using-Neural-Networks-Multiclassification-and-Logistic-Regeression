# Handwritten-Digit-Classifier-Using-Neural-Networks-Multiclassification-and-Logistic-Regeression

--> A project type course, it's objective is to successfully classify hand written grey-scale digits. Every image fed to this classifier must be 20 pixels by 20 pixels, each pixel having its own colour intensity. Each image that is fed hence has 400 features corresponding to the grey-scale intensity values of each pixel.

--> Using refined Logistic regression algorithms,optimization algorithms and neural network feed-forward propagation algorithms, this code successfully classifies the images with an accuracy of  94.9% and 97.5% (logistic regression and neural networks respectively).
